# Topic: suicide rate analysis

# Project title: Seniors living affluent Europe are vulnerable
Using the suicide rate data collected by WHO, I created a Jupyter Notebook to visualize the data and identify the population at high risk of suicide.

## Main Data Source
* [Kaggle dataset: WHO Suicide Statistics]( https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics)
* The above dataset is from the [WHO Mortality Database]( https://apps.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality/whodpms/)

## Purpose
This project was completed as part of my self-directed learning of data science.
